Introduction  \nThe histo ry of the automobile dates to the year 1885 when the first production automobile was \ndeveloped by Karl Benz in Mannheim, Germany. It was called \u201cBenz Patent -Motorwagen\u201d and used a \ngasoline -powered internal combustion engine. Then came the \u201cFord Model T\u201d by  Ford Motor \nCompany in 1908, which was mass -produced on an assembly line. It was assembled at Ford\u2019s Piquette \nAvenue Assembly Plant in Detroit, Michigan. During its production that spanned from 1908 to 1927, \nover 15 million Model T automobiles were produce d. \nThere has been a lot of enthusiasm about autonomous cars. For an autonomous car to navigate \neffectively, technologies from multiple disciplines need to be combined. These disciplines broadly \ninclude computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering [1]. \u201cLinriccan Wonder\u201d \nof the 1920s was the first radio -controlled car. In 1939, electric cars powered by embedded -circuits \nwere showcased. 1980 saw the advent of a robotic van by Mercedes -Benz, that used vision gu ided \nsystems. This was the starting point for the origin of technologies used at present in modern vehicles. \nThese technologies include lane keep assist, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, etc.  \nAccording  to World Health Organization\u2019s report  on road traffic injuries (February 2020), there are", "metadata": {"source": "tests/data/automotiveTestArticle.pdf", "page": 1}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "According  to World Health Organization\u2019s report  on road traffic injuries (February 2020), there are \napproximately 1.35 million deaths per year, caused by road crashes.

These errors can be caused by over -speeding, driving under the influence of \nalcohol or distractions during driving (such as usage of mobile phones). Other errors include non -\nusage of seatbelts, helmets, or other safety equipment  [2].  \nThese statistics advocate the need of broad adoption and advancement of  autonomous vehicle \ntechnology.  Without this, the number of transportation injuries and deaths are only expected to \nincrease.

This impli es that on \nan average a car spends approximately 96% of the time in parking [3]. Thus, the advent of \nautonomous cars would reduce the need of private car ownership altogether, since a ride -sharing \nmodel that uses autonomous rob o-taxis can be implemented. This potential use of a ride -sharing app \nwill be implemented by Cruise in its \u201cOrigin\u201d autonomous vehicle, which will not be available for \nprivate ownership at all. Autonomous vehicles can also be beneficial in the domain of del ivery of \ngoods, which can be made more reliable and efficient by their use.  \nAlthough autonomous cars provide a host of benefits, some challenges do exist in their \ndevelopment and commercialization. One of the primary challenges is the requirement of a leg al \nframework and regulations. There may arise certain situations on road in which an autonomous system \nis unable to decide whether to save its own passengers, or other pedestrians/vehicle.

About autonomous cars \nAn autonomous vehicle can operate without requirement of any human control and can sense the \nenvironment.

It was founded in 2013. In 2016, it was acquired by \nGeneral Motors. Since then, the company is developing software for General Motors Chevrolet Bolt. \nThis software would be used to make the car autonomous. The Bolt uses several LIDAR sensors from \nVelodyne. In January 2020, Cruise unveiled the Origin, which is a fully autonomous car without a  \n steering wheel or pedals.  This enables the EV to go straight to level 5 (or level 4 within defined \nareas) of autonomous driving. The vehicle has a symmetrical design, with the 2 rows of seats facing \neach other. It is designed to do highway speeds. The vehicle is modular and will have a lifespan of 1 \nmillion miles \u2013 six times more than the average car.

Challenges and Possible Solutions  \nThis section includes the various challenges that must be addressed in order to ensur e smooth \ndevelopment and proper commercialization of autonomous cars. The technical challenges are \ndiscussed below in detail:  \n \n5.1. Safety and Reliability   \nBefore full commercialization, the technology must be tested for several million miles. The reliabil ity \nof a system is determined by the distance travelled by the car. As per the requirements, an autonomous \ncar must drive around 291 million miles without loss of lives (by accidents) to ensure a 95% \nequivalence to a human driver  [18]. These requirements for miles and the resulting number of years \nremain too high, even if we reduce the percentage of equivalence required. Another factor for \ncomprehensive safety test is the number of \u201cchallenging / difficult\u201d miles. According to th e 2018 \nsafety report by General Motors, the number of challenging on -road situations, such as construction -\nblocked lanes and left turns, are 40 times higher in San Francisco, CA than in Phoenix, AZ. Even \nthough the vehicles tested in \u201ceasy miles\u201d locations  will accumulate miles at a faster rate, but the \namount of learning would be less substantial.", "metadata": {"source": "tests/data/automotiveTestArticle.pdf", "page": 6}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "amount of learning would be less substantial.  \nEven though the California state law has allowed the testing of fully autonomous cars without \nsafety drivers on public roads (since February 2018), the deploymen t remains a challenge due to lack \nof trust. The first fatal crash occurred in March 2018 when a Level -4 Uber prototype crashed into a \npedestrian crossing a road  [19].  According to the NTSB report, there were two points to note : First, \nthe automated emergency braking system was disabled on the test vehicle, and second, the pedestrian \nwas detected, but was not identified correctly as a human. This incident, along with another fatal \nincident that occurred 5 days later involving a Level -2 Tesla Autopilot system, raised questions about \nthe safety and maturity of autonomous cars  [19]. \nConsidering these prospects, the University of Michigan\u2019s autonomous car testing facility \u2018Mcity \u2019 \nat Ann Arbor, Michigan has proposed an independent safety test, called the Mcity ABC Test. The \nmain aim of the Mcity ABC Test is to test the performance of automated vehicles, in terms of safety.  \nIt consists of three main components: Accelerated evaluat ion, Behavio ur competence, and Corner \ncases  [19]. \nAccelerated evaluation focuses on three main scenarios: lane change, car following, and left turns. \nIn Accelerated evaluation, initially naturalistic driving data is collected. This data reflects what the t est \nvehicles will be facing in normal conditions on public roads. In the next step, driver behavio ur is", "metadata": {"source": "tests/data/automotiveTestArticle.pdf", "page": 6}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "vehicles will be facing in normal conditions on public roads.

Waymo list [13] is also one of the collections of scenarios. A total of 50 scenarios \nare selected. Weather and lighting are also one of the factors that are con sidered. Lighting conditions \nare tested under daytime and night -time. Components such as radars, LIDARs, and cameras are tested \nin rain and snow. After this testing, 35 scenarios have been finally selected. Further testing shows that \nfor low -speed shuttles  having GPS -defined paths, only 16 scenarios are needed.  \nCorner cases involve cases that are on extremities of the test conditions. For instance, one of the \ncorner cases can be detecting dark colo ured cars in dark surroundings using cameras. Zig -zag motion \nof joggers on the street, cyclists taking left turn in busy traffic are some of the challenging cases \nenlisted in the Waymo Safety Report.    \n \n5.2. Validation and testing:  \nAutonomous systems requi re comprehensive testing, because the system is complex, and any decision \nmade by the software affects human lives directly. The ISO 26262 standard provides a framework for \nvehicle -guidance systems considering the functional safety  [20].

This model works fine \nfor generic automotive systems. However, due to a complex set of requirements and a high degree of \nuncertainty i n autonomous systems, the traditional validation and testing techniques are not feasible. \nThus, an alternative approach is needed. Machine learning has a probability of being more powerful \nfor building an exhaustive system that helps in decision -making. Ma chine learning involves many \ntypes such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, semi -supervised learning, \nactive and inductive learning. For the purpose of detection of objects, the classifiers of machine \nlearning algorithms need to b e trained on large amount of data  [9]. This makes the testing process even \nmore challenging.  \nFail-operational system  design  is also a challenge, because at least two independent, redundant \nsubsystems are required, so that if on e part fails another one can take over [21]. \nFault injection techniques  use external equipment to introduce defects into the hardware of a target \nsystem. These defects may be introduced with or without contact. Faults such as fo rced voltage \nchanges, forced current addition can be introduced by direct contact. Fault injections such as exposure \nto magnetic field can trigger bit flips and hardware faults. These faults are introduced without making \nphysical contact [22].", "metadata": {"source": "tests/data/automotiveTestArticle.pdf", "page": 7}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "to magnetic field can trigger bit flips and hardware faults.

Orientation (knowledge of position relative to surroundings)  \nMultiple factors contribute to the orientation challenges faced by autonomous vehicles. The primary \ncause of this problem are the dynamic situations on the roads, such as road diversions, construction \nsites, and missing road signs and markings. Multiple st rategies have been adopted by different \ncompanies to overcome this challenge [23] \nReal time image processing and machine learning approach, that has been deployed in Tesla \nvehicles has multiple benefits.

Legal challenges  \nThe requir ement of a legal framework and regulations  is one of the most important requirements for \ndeployment of autonomous vehicles. The question of who is to be held liable in event of an \nemergency/collision is also another challenge. With the development of auton omous vehicles, there is \na clear shift of responsibility for accidents from drivers to the companies that design and develop these \nvehicles. Therefore, it is imperative that laws are revised, considering the presence of autonomous \nvehicles on public roads.  A clear and concise policy that addresses the concerns of a  potential \nconsumer is required.  \n \n5.5. Moral and ethical aspects  \nAnother major challenge involves decision -making in the event of emergency situations. When \nconfronted with challenging situations on the road, autonomous cars may face decisions having moral \nimplications, such as necessarily deciding between putting the lives of the passengers at risk versus \ncrashing into a nearby pedestrian, or slamming the brakes to avoid hitting the pedestrian whi ch may \nput the lives of the passengers at risk. Making justifiable decisions under these situations could be a \ndaunting task.", "metadata": {"source": "tests/data/automotiveTestArticle.pdf", "page": 7}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "ICCRDA 2020\nIOP Conf. Series: Materials Science and Engineering 1022 (2021) 012028IOP Publishing\ndoi:10.1088/1757-899X/1022/1/012028\n8 \n \n \n \n \n \nAs of February 2020, the only country in the world with actual guidelines on the decision making \nof autonomous vehicles is Germany . According to a 2017 report on \u2018Autonomous and Connected \nDriving\u2019 by the German Ethics Commission  [24], \u201cIn the event of unavoidable accident situations, any \ndistinction based on personal features (age, gender, physical or ment al constitution) is strictly \nprohibited. It is also prohibited to offset victims against one another. General programming to reduce \nthe number of personal injuries may be justifiable.\u201d Although this may seem ideal, these preferences \nmay vary due to differe nces in moral attitudes. For example, according to \u201cThe Moral Machine \nExperiment\u201d  [25], people tend to give preference to saving the young over the old, saving more lives \nin preference over fewer lives.  \nTo overcome these chall enges, all the stakeholders must be transparent about the choices and the \nrationales backing them, while analysing the risks and benefits associated.  \n \n5.6. Financial challenges  \nHigh cost related to development and adoption of autonomous vehicles is a challenge. The technology \nand components, such as sensors and communication devices used in vehicles with higher levels of \nautomation could result in these features being available i n only premium tier production vehicles, \nraising questions about affordability for end -consumers.", "metadata": {"source": "tests/data/automotiveTestArticle.pdf", "page": 8}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "raising questions about affordability for end -consumers.  \nOne of the possible solutions for higher costs could be the use of hiring (ride -sharing) model for \nvehicles, operated by for -profit organizations. Robo -taxis , such as those planned by Cruise for its \n\u2018Origin\u2019 vehicle, are based on this model. This model would result in distribution of costs over a large \nnumber of individuals. By analyzing  the costs associated with robo -taxis implementing the ride -\nsharing model,  the primary contributor of high fares would be the utilization rate of the robo -taxis, \nwhich is the time spent by the vehicles in transporting passengers. This rate currently stands at 50% \nfor current taxis.  [26] \nTherefore, in order to ensure significant adoption of autonomous vehicles in future, the technology \nmust be affordable.  \n \n6. Conclusion  \nAlthough autonomous car companies have made phenomenal progress in the technology, it will still \ntake many years for full y autonomous cars to become available to public. Specifying a definite year \nmay not be possible at this stage. According to some predictions, cars may become fully autonomous \nby 2035. Even though the technology is developing, we must also be ready to utili ze it. Also, the \nchallenges discussed earlier must be overcome in order to ensure a smooth development of the \ntechnology. It is hoped that this paper provides clear insight into the field of autonomous vehicle \ntechnolog y. \n \n7.
